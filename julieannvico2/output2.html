										<p><i><b>Bonsai </b><br />
											Edith Tiempo<br /><br />
											
											All that I love<br />
											I fold over once<br />
											And once again<br />
											And keep in a box<br />
											Or a slit in a hollow post<br />
											Or in my shoe.<br /><br />
											
											All that I love?<br />
											Why, yes, but for the moment-<br />
											And for all time, both.<br />
											Something that folds and keeps easy,<br />
											Son’s note or Dad’s one gaudy tie,<br />
											A roto picture of a queen,<br />
											A blue Indian shawl, even<br />
											A money bill.<br /><br />
											
											It’s utter sublimation,<br />
											A feat, this heart’s control<br />
											Moment to moment<br />
											To scale all love down<br />
											To a cupped hand’s size<br />
											
											Till seashells are broken pieces<br />
											From God’s own bright teeth,<br />
											And life and love are real<br />
											Things you can run and<br />
											Breathless hand over<br />
											To the merest child.</i></p>

												<b>José Garcia Villa's Poem</b><br /><br />
												In my desire to be Nude<br />
												I clothed myself in fire:—<br />
												Burned down my walls, my roof,<br />
												Burned all these down.<br /><br />

												Emerged myself supremely lean<br />
												Unsheathed like a holy knife.<br />
												With only His Hand to find<br />
												To hold me beyond annul.<br /><br />

												And found Him found Him found Him<br />
												Found the Hand to hold me up!<br />
												He held me like a burning poem<br />
												And waved me all over the world.<br />

									<p>The first poem “Bonsai” by Edith Tiempo is basically a poem talking about a love of a mother, love that can be passed on or being handed over to her daughter. This poem is about love is simplified and reduced so that one can give it out to others. The elements of poetry present here is oxymoron or what we called figure of speech in which apparently contradictory terms appear in conjunction and that stanza is “All that I love? Why, yes but for the moment- and for all the time, both.”   Another literary image was shown in the poem was the “to a cupped hand’s size” this stanza shows that love can reduced into something small that could hand over to everyone.</p>

									<p>The second poem “In my desire to be nude” by Jose Garcia Villa. This poem shows the destiny of the person what they want to be. It can be also in their experiences because the writer is talking about his life, how he encounters or how he manages to conquer his problem in life having belief in God. It also shows us that the character changed because they want to satisfied or felt the need to be accepted by everyone but otherwise, they were proven wrong they should always follow instead what they want. The poem used metaphors and did not use rhyming words but repeated some words.</p>

									<p>For me making poems can help you to reduce or heal our emotional pain by writing all the questions, situations, and experiences that running in our mind by telling everybody what you went through without actually telling them, sometimes reading poems are hard to understand because of its deep meaning but once if you already understand it’s meaning you, will also understand what the writer or the poet is trying to convey to the readers. </p>
